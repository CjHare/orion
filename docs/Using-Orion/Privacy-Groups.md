# Privacy Groups 

When [transactions are sent](../Reference/API-Methods.md#send) to: 

* List of recipients, Orion creates a privacy group containing the recipients 
* Privacy group, the transaction is distributed to all members of the privacy group. 

Pantheon maintains a [private state per privacy group](https://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/stable/Privacy/Privacy-Overview/#privacy-groups). 

Endpoints are provided to create and manage privacy groups: 

* [privacyGroupId](../Reference/API-Methods.md#privacygroupid) 
* [findPrivacyGroupId](../Reference/API-Methods.md#findprivacygroupid) 
* [deletePrivacyGroupId](../Reference/API-Methods.md#deleteprivacygroupid)
