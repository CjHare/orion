# Privacy Groups 

For each transaction, the transaction payload is distributed to each participant in the privacy group. 

Either the privacy group either already exists with a defined list of members -> payload submitted to all members. 

Or doesn't exist -> privacy group is created with privateFrom and privateFor as members and and payload
sent to all members. 

Pantheon maintains a private state per privacy group.
